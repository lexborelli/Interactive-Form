# Interactive-Form
In this project, I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I added JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

-Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity

-Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
